# UI-UX-Experiment5
Present 2 different UX project scenarios (e.g., designing a health app, an e-commerce site, or a government service portal).
## Aim:
To analyze, define, and design user-centered solutions for two different digital product scenarios (Health App and Government Service Portal) 
using UX methods such as problem identification, user research, persona creation, and visual design prototyping in Figma.


## Algorithm:
Select two UX project scenarios for analysis (e.g., Health App, Government Portal).

Identify key user pain points in each scenario.

Frame 1–2 problem statements for each using the format:
[User] needs a way to [achieve goal] because [obstacle], which results in [impact].

Select appropriate UX research methods based on user context.

Justify the chosen research methods.

Create at least two detailed user personas per scenario, including demographics, goals, behaviors, pain points, and motivation.

Design visual representations in Figma:

Personas

Problem statement section

Research cards/tables

Export the entire work as a PDF.

Upload the PDF and relevant files to GitHub.
